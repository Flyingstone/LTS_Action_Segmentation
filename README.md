# LTS Action Segmentation
This repository contains code for our TIP (Transactions on Image Processing) paper: Low-Rank Transfer Human Motion Segmentation (LTS). LTS is a journal extension on our previous work, Learning Transferable Subspace for Human Motion Segmentation, which proposed a novel low-rank constraint associate with the temporal constraint for human action segmentation in time space. Experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed model.
